# port-scanner
Simple port scanner with 2 different functions

My very first coding experience that wasn't a "Hello World". I combined two (2) different open source port scanners, that  work differently, and the user chooses what function to use each run. Links for them and what exactly I changed on them individually (besides joining them and asking for user input to decide which one to use):

The first one would scan all ports from 1 to 1025 and print the open ones. I had just finished learning about variables so  I wanted to implement that: the program will now ask fofr input to decide both the port it'll start scanning on and the last port it'll scan, scanning all ports within that range. I've also removed anything related to dates and times since I found that wasn't really that needed.

Now to the second one, I didnt't make any major changes besides changing the input type at line 8, since the program wasn't working as it was. Link: https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/Python3PentestingTools/blob/master/PortScanner.py
