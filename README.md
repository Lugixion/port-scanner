# port-scanner
Simple port scanner with 2 different functions

My very first coding experience that wasn't a "Hello World". I combined two (2) different open source port scanners, that  work differently, and the user chooses what function to use each run. Links for them and what exactly I changed on them individually (besides joining them and asking for user input to decide which one to use):

The first one would scan all ports from 1 to 1025 and print the open ones. This has been "heavily" modified. Link to the source: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/port-scanner-in-python/

Now to the second one, I didnt't make any changes as of now. Link: https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/Python3PentestingTools/blob/master/PortScanner.py

Special thanks to:
@salt-die for helping me with the loops to check if inputs are valid
